            Additionally, accounting documents reveal that you were issued a prior reminder through FMR No. xxxx-xxxx and a subsequent demand through FMD No. xxxx-xxxx, but no substantial compliance has been made by you in relation thereto. This already constitutes wilful negligence on your part with respect to a reasonable official order and an outright refusal by you to perform an obligation required by law.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
            Now therefore, pursuant to Section 5 of the <em>Sanctions for Violations of Rules and Regulations Related to the Liquidation of Cash Advances</em> (hereinafter referred to as <strong>Sanctions</strong>), as adopted through BOR Resolution No. 56, s. 2024, you are <strong>DIRECTED TO LIQUIDATE</strong> your cash advance with the following alternatives:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2">
            <li>Liquidate the cash advance in full;</li>
            <li>Execute a Waiver for Deduction Against Personnel Pay for the outstanding balance of the cash advance; or</li>
            <li>Make partial liquidation of the cash advance and execute a Waiver for Deduction Against Personnel Pay for the remainder.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-4">
            Furthermore, pursuant to Section 7 of the same <strong>Sanctions</strong>, you are hereby <strong>ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE</strong> in writing as to why you should not be cited for:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-xs">
            <li><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE</strong> offenses under Section 5 of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 23, s. 2019 in relation to Section 53, Rule 10 of the RRACCS; and</li>
            <li><strong>CRIMINAL</strong> offenses under the penal provisions of Paragraph 9.3.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 in relation to Sections 89 and 128 of PD 1445, and under Article 218 of The Revised Penal Code.</li>
