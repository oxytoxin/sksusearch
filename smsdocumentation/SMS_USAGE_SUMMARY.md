## 🔧 To Enable SMS Notifications

All SMS implementations are commented out and ready to enable. To activate:

1. **Open the file** you want to enable
2. **Locate the SMS block** using the line numbers above
3. **Uncomment the SMS code** by removing the `//` from each line
4. **Test with test phone first** (test phone number is already in place)
5. **Switch to production** by uncommenting the actual phone number line

### Example (from any file):

```php
// ========== SMS NOTIFICATION (COMMENTED OUT) ==========
// if ($user->employee_information && !empty($user->employee_information->contact_number)) {
//     SendSmsJob::dispatch(
//         '09273464891',  // TEST PHONE - Remove this line for production
//         // $user->employee_information->contact_number,  // PRODUCTION - Uncomment this
//         $message,
//         'context_name',
//         $user->id,
//         Auth::id()
//     );
// }
// ========== SMS NOTIFICATION END ==========
```
