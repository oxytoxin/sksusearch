Class I Biosafety Cabinet does not protect the product from contamination because un-purified room air constantly enters into work area; 2. As a partical containment unit; the class I Biosafety cabinet is suitable for work involving low to moderate risk agents (Biosafety Levels 1; 2 and 3) where there is a need for containment; but not for product protection.; 3. Unlike conventional fume hood; the HEPA filter in the I Biosafety Cabinet protects the environment by filtering air before it is exhausted.; 4. With the negative pressure; personnelprotection is made possible by constant movement of air into the work area.; Advantage: Soft touch control panel; LCD display.; 2. UV lamp for Sterilization.; 3. Stable air flow system; provide firm protection to person and environment. 4. Energy-saving; high efficiency; low noise.; 5. One piece 304 stainless steel work stable; easy for cleaning.; 6.

Suction Tube Feeding Simulator with storage bag SPECS: â€¢Silicone rubber is used for the model; so that students can practice with an exterior and feel that are very close to those of a living human body.â€¢ Insertion of suction catheters into the nasal cavity; oral cavity and suctioning practice can be performed.The facial region can be divided into two halves along the midline; allowing confirmation of the actual insertion status of a suction catheter or nasogastric tube. The model is also designed to enable study of the anatomical structures of the nasal cavity; oral cavity and cervical area.â€¢ The simulated sputum provided as an accessory can be inserted into the nasal cavity; oral cavity or trachea; for training. This allows students to train in the same manner as the actual procedure; and enabels more effective suction training. (Viscosity of the simulated sputum can be controlled using water.) Tube feeding & Gastrostomy careâ€¢ The facial region can be divided into two halves along the midline; allowing confirmation of the actual insertion status of a suction catheter or nasogastric tube. The model is also designed to enable study of the anatomical structures of the nasal cavity; oral cavity and cervical area.â€¢ Insertion of the feeding tube all the way to the gastric fundus can be practiced. Air bubble sounds can be heard and suction of gastric fluid can be used to confirm the insertion of the tube.â€¢ Placement and care of gastrostomy tube can be practiced.â€¢ The tube feeding components come with an internal tank; allowing nasogastric tube feeding and gastrostomy management using actual liquids. Techniques can also be practiced using actual nutrient solution; equivalent to routine nursing care settings.â€¢ The tank has a drainage function; so there is no need to worry about overflow when the tank becomes full.â€¢ The model can be taken apart for very easy maintenance. The tanks for liquids are washable; so hygiene is not a worry. â€¢ Ankle â€“ Eversion; Inversion; Dorsiflexion; Plantarflexionâ€¢ Elbow â€“ Extension; Flexion; Pronation; Supinationâ€¢ Fingers â€“ Abduction; Adduction; Flexion (soft; lifelike material)â€¢ Hip â€“ Abduction; Adduction; Rotation; Hyperextensionâ€¢ Knee â€“ Extension; Flexionâ€¢ Neck â€“ Rotation; Hyperextension; Lateral Flexion â€¢ Shoulder â€“ Abduction; Adduction; Rotation; Hyperextensionâ€¢ Toes â€“ Abduction; Adduction; Flexion (soft; lifelike material)â€¢ Trunk â€“ Rotation; HyperextensionWrist â€“ Flexion; Hyperextension; Radial Flexion; Ulnar FlexionIncludes all of the main features of the Basic GERiâ„¢ and KERiâ„¢ Manikins with the addition of:â€¢ Gastrostomy Procedures â€” Lavage and Gavageâ€¢ Pap Smears and Douchingâ€¢ Enema Administration â€” Female Onlyâ€¢ Prostate Exam â€” Stage Bâ€¢ Urinary Catheterization â€” Female and Nasogastric Tube Placementâ€¢ Uncircumcised Maleâ€¢ Internal Fluid ReservoirsSh.
